## Use CLI, don't use GUI

[Follow up reading](https://lmddgtfy.net/?q=git%20why%20use%20cli%20instead%20of%20gui)

Note:
- Until you're a git pro at least
- It's not about being haxxxor, it's about learning
- If you nead a reason: there are lots of GUIs, yet only one CLI - that means more SO resources for the CLI



## Have handy info at hand

- Am I in git repo?
- What branch am I on?
- Is my repository dirty?


### [Don't reinvent the wheel!](https://web.archive.org/web/20160704140739/http://ithaca.arpinum.org/2013/01/02/git-prompt.html)

- `__git_ps1`
- Requires `bash-completion` package installed and imported to your `.bashrc`
- Configurable, ex. `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1`

Note:
- dummy example: `export PS1=$PS1$(__git_ps1); GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1`
- `bash-completion` package may be already installed and imported (at least it is on Ubuntu 16.04 and Debian Stretch)
- need to hook it up to your prompt, see my dotfiles for details (`allgreed/dotfiles/.bash_prompt`)



### Use SSH (by default!)

- no need to type passwords
- no trouble when setting up 2FA
- much more secure solution
